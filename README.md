# Test Driven Blog App

This is a basic test driven blog application using RSpec.

## Steps to use

I have removed the `database.yml` file so a new file will need to be created

`bundle && bin/rails db:create && bin/rails db:migrate && bin/rails s`

## Software Used

The following software has been used to build this application:

* Ruby on Rails 6
* RSpec
* MySQL
* SCSS
